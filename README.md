How to set up your brand new game:
1. First things first, you need to set up a server.
  This is easy, just start the game, select New Game, and select Server.
  Enter the port of your choice (5000 and above). Then share the ip with your friend
2. Two players now need to connect to the server. They do this by launching the game, selecting new game,
  and selecting Client. They then enter the ip and the port of the server and enter the name they wish
  to play with. Then they press connect.
3. Once both players are in the game has begun.

How to play this fantastic game:
The object of the game is to escape. It isn't a race, you can work together.
To turn your character, click the arrows at the left or right side of the screen. To go through doors,
right-click on them and select Enter. Some doors may be locked to you at the beginning.
Explore the rooms and find items to help you escape. There are several useful items to find including:
  1.The Map
    The Map is a vital tool to get you out of there. When opened from the inventory it will show you all the rooms
    making it much easier to find your way around. But be warned: the map is randomly rotated until you find:
  2.The Compass
    The Compass isn't a huge help on its own, but when paired with the map it tells you exactly which way is which,
    so getting out will be a breeze. The compass is used automatically when you open the map while holding
    the compass
    
Keys allow you to get through locked doors. Once you unlock a door it will always be unlocked, so your friend
can follow behind on your heels. If you look hard you might also find coins scattered around. These might
come in handy once you've almost found your way out.

How to save and load in this masterful game:
Saving is easy. At any point in your game, select File -> Save. This will save you game in an XML file.
If you want to open the file, we reccomend using a web browser such as Chrome, or Internet Explorer.
Don't edit the file, that would be cheating!
Once you've made a save, at any time while playing the game either player can select File -> Load.
This will load the save you previously made like magic. It's not magic, it was a lot of hard work.
